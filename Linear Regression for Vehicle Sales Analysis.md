Analytical in sales world was a common method for organization to build up their marketing plan. Track of sales will give them a lot of information such as sales result, geographical popularity, brand awareness and etc. Effective analytic provide effective facts which helps organization to better determine their next course of action. In machine learning, linear regression if often used to see the progress of single variance over a constant parameter. As an example shown in one of the repositories (refer to the link: https://github.com/skhurana333/ml/blob/master/linearRegSingleVariant.py), to have a basic linear regression with single variant could help others to reuse in TenserFlow.js. 

Adaptation of the linear regression could be done with the vehicle sale example, with an improvisation of allowing the function to be able to receive different input for each of the parameter. Refer to below variable definition:

      y = Result of monitored item. (e.g: vehicles sold for each year)

      c = value of constant parameter. (e.g: constant value of difference between parameter in graph)

      a = slope line. (e.g: value of slope between parameter in graph)

      x = comparison parameter. (e.g: GDP of the prior year)


The parameter will then be used for the linear regression algorithm as followed:

      y = c + ax format
