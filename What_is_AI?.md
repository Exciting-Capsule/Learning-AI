# What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a machine or a computer program to think and learn. 
The concept of AI is based on the idea of building machines capable of thinking, acting, and learning like humans.

While some people falsely consider AI a technology, the more accurate approach would be seeing it as a broad concept 
in which machines are able to deal with tasks in a way we would call intelligent or smart.

There are certain things a machine/computer program must be capable of to be considered AI.

It should be able to mimic human thought process and behavior. Second, 
it should act in a human-like way—intelligent, rational, and ethical.

## Where Is AI Used?
Many people associate AI with the distant future. 
Take Siri or Alexa—personal assistants that have already become the new normal for thousands of people around the globe.
These and similar intelligent gadgets are able to recognize our speech, analyze the information they have access to, and provide an answer or solution.
Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music are some other touching points between AI and you. These services are capable of recommending music based on your interests. 
Other examples of artificial intelligence in use today include smart home devices like Google’s NEST, self-driving cars like those produced by Tesla, and online games like Alien: Isolation.


## Will AI Take Over?
Some people claim that AI is still in its infancy. Others assure us that we are only a few years away from AI gaining control over humanity. The truth, however, lies somewhere in between.
Experts Predict that within the next decade AI will outperform humans in relatively simple tasks such as translating languages, writing school essays, and driving trucks. More complicated tasks like writing a bestselling book or working as a surgeon, however, will take machines much more time to learn. 
AI is expected to master these two skills by 2049 and 2053 accordingly.

It is a widespread point of view that one day not only will AI exceed human performance but it will also extend beyond human control. With so many fearful articles out there, questions like “is artificial intelligence safe?” or “is artificial intelligence bad for people?” should come as no surprise. AI is obviously exciting but simultaneously warrants caution.


So far, one thing remains perfectly clear: creating AI is one of the most remarkable events for humankind. After all, AI is considered a major component of 4th Industrial Revolution, and its potential socioeconomic impact is believed to be as huge as the invention of electricity once had.

In light of this, the smartest approach would be keeping an eye on how the technology evolves, taking advantage of the improvements it brings to our lives, and not getting too nervous at the thought of machine takeover.
